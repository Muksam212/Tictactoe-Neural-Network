Making The Tic Tac Toe Game Using Artificial Neural Network.

ANN stands for Artificial Network Neural. It is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain's neural structure. It comprises interconnected nodes (neurons) organized into layers.
Data flows through these nodes, adjusting the weights of connections to learn patterns and make predictions.
